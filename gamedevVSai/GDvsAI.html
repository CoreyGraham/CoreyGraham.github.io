The first section has the player complete as many sequences of directional key inputs as they can while a 30s timer counts down. Each completed sequence grants the player points for the length of the sequence.</p>

            <ul class="text">
                <li>The Attack action gains a set amount of support with the player being able to complete sequences to gain additional support.</li>
                <li>The Defence action gains defence points which stop the opponent from gain support until all defence points are gone.</li>
                <li>The Counter action gains support only from sequences complete, but gains significantly more support for each sequence than the Attack action. For the Robot, this action randomises how much support they gain, with a variable amount above and below that of the Attack Action.</li>
                <li>The Banter action gains a boost to the next action performed. This doesn't chain into itself.</li>

            <p class="text">After 6 rounds, a winner is decided by the support bar at the top of the screen. The amount the bar has to be filled for the player depends on the difficulty of the robot which increases with each loop of the game. This difficulty increace also affect the strength of each action for the Robot.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Visual Design: Section 1</h3>
            <p class="text">The visual design of the game focuses on simplicity. For the first section of the game the sequences that the player has to complete are shown at the bottom of the screen while the time is placed at the top and the points gain are on the side. This places each important element in clear view, seperated by the animation of the player character typing code onto their monitor. These animations are achieved through swapping constumes (for example, 1 costume is the player character upright and one is slightly squished, creating a bobbing effect).</p>

            <h3 class="title">Section 2</h3>
            <p class="text">For the second section, it was important to create the atmoshpere of the conflict with the robot. In order to do this, I created a layout in the style of a live debate. The crowd aspect of this is done through cloning and randomising costume and response timing, making the crowd feel believable. This is coupled with a spotlight effect on both the player and robots turn.</p>
